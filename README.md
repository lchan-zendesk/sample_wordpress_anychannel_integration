# Example AnyChannel integration with Wordpress using Node Express

## Description
This repository contains the source code for an integration service that connects
Zendesk to Wordpress.  It is intended to be used with the AnyChannel tutorial
(TODO: Add link once it's available.)

It only works with Wordpress instances that have the "rest-api" and "JSON Basic Authentication"
plug-ins.
